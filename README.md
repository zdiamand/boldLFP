Datafile for P63 = https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ypVlKY7qKQkrzv4XEg3wfyw5YPUaYmb/view?usp=sharing (caltech email required)

Order of operations: The two loopLFPChannels scripts are run on the above datafile - one to extract the unsliced time series, and one to extract the outcome aligned sliced time series. The outcome aligned sliced time series is used purely to extract the trial times for later use. Once both of these scripts are run and the resultant data is saved, you can run the main script: sliced_timeFreqLFP_nocut_CLEAN to get the time frequency decomposition and resultant image.
